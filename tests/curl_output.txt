tion to the Language B* from 1972, where it was initially used to demonstrate how to use external variables in B[8]. Since then, it has become the standard introductory example for teaching basic syntax and fundamental programming concepts across virtually all programming languages[8].\n\n## Complexity Across Languages\n\nThe simplicity of a \"Hello, World!\" program varies significantly depending on the language. In scripting languages like Python, you only need a single statement, while low-level languages may require multiple statements[4]. Here are examples across different languages:\n\n**C:**\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    printf(\"Hello, World!\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n[1]\n\n**Rust:**\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello World!\");\n}\n```\n[6]\n\n**BASIC:**\n```basic\n10 PRINT \"Hello World!\"\n20 GOTO 10\n```\n[5]\n\n## Modern Variations\n\nBeyond simple text output, \"Hello, World!\" programs have evolved to include graphical variations. Sun demonstrated a version in Java using scalable vector graphics, and the XL programming language features a spinning 3D Earth[4]. In computer graphics, rendering a \"Hello Triangle\" is sometimes used as an introductory example for graphics libraries[4].\n\nThere are now over 600 \"Hello, World!\" implementations across various programming languages available in collections dedicated to documenting these programs[2]."},"delta":{"role":"assistant","content":""},"finish_reason":"stop"}]}
